I studied Social Welfare at Seojeong University and was active in student council.\n\nI still remember how lonely and lost I felt when I first arrived in Korea. I couldn't speak the language, and everything was unfamiliar. That's why I started V-HOUSE - to be a 'Vietnamese home in Korea' for those who are new here, just like I was.\n\nLet me help make your trip to Korea a warm memory!"
